This repository contains several addosn that I made for fun.
The current addons available here are:
  - coolSpawnersAddon: a big bunch of new spawner classes with their goofy minions, include Arms race tiers but still works without the arms race addon 
  (which is not even released as I write this lol). Include the auto and factory versions of the tier 3 spawners (if basic is tier 0).
  - pentaFinalAddon: I thought it was dumb that there was no pentagon final boss so... I made one! it is a mix of all pentagon-based bosses, plus some others weapons that fit well.

Have fun with those!
